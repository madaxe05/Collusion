# Collision Game

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Collision Game** is a fast-paced, interactive game built using **Python** and **Pygame**. The goal is to control the player (a red square) and collide with the target (a blue square) as many times as possible within 60 seconds, while avoiding obstacles. The game features collision detection, random target respawn, and a simple GUI interface.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎯 **Target Collisions** - Increase your score by colliding with the target.
- 🏃 **Player Movement** - Control the player with arrow keys.
- 🟩 **Obstacles** - Navigate through obstacles that block your movement.
- 💥 **Sound Effects** - Play a sound on every collision with the target.
- 🏆 **Game Over Screen** - Displays your score and the result at the end of the game.
- 🔄 **Restart Option** - Press SPACE to restart the game or Q to quit.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core Logic)
- **Pygame** (Game Development Framework)
